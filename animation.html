          This page is dedicated to my animation work. I've always loved to
          watch animated movies and shows, but recently I've started to make
          animations myself. I've followed a few electives during my studies
          where I learned to make 2D and 3D animations. I also spent half a year
          making an animated short film. Below is some of my work in animation.

          <h2>Thirst</h2>
          <p>
            In my second year of CMD, I followed an elective where I learned the
            fundamentals of 2D animation. I experimented with a lot of different
            animation styles and I eventually made a short animation, Thirst,
            about a girl living by a waterfall who is being watched by a
            mysterious creature. You can watch it

          <h2>Had Je Maar</h2>
          <p>
            In my third year of CMD, I followed an external elective of Visual
            Communication called 'Storytelling Fiction', where I spent half a
            year making an animated short film. I had decided early on I wanted
            to adapt my story as a short animation. I wrote a scenario, which
            took up the first half of the elective. <br /><br />After I was
            satisfied with the story and had decided on a visual style, I could
            finally start animating. I really enjoyed the process, and the end
            product, made in collaboration with my classmate Myko Thomas, turned
            out great. You can click the link to view the preview for

          <p>
            In my second year of CMD, I followed an elective where I learned the
            basics of Blender to make 3D animations. I wanted to make satisfying
            renders, an example of which you can see here. You can check out

          <h2>Knip Musical</h2>
          <p>
            The high school I used to go to has its own musical group that
            performs a musical every year in the biggest theatre in Helmond. I
            personally know the producer, and he approached me for the design of
            the poster for their musical, Ik hou van jou. The following year I
            also designed the poster for their new musical, Pinokkio. On top of
            that I designed the new logo for Knip Musical.

          <h2>Album covers</h2>
          <p>
            This is nothing serious, but I'm still proud of it. Music is a very
            important part of my life, and sometimes I make some myself. I
            constantly update and create new playlists. Sometimes, I combine my
            love for music and graphic design and make album covers for my
            playlists.

          <p>
            In recent years, I've created my own logo and style, as seen on this
            website. I've also created a few other things, like these visuals,
            to practise my graphic design.
