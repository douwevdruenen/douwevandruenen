        <p>
          For as long as I can remember I've loved to draw. A few years ago I
          started drawing digitally as well. My art mostly revolves around
          character design, as I love world-building and creating characters to
          inhabit those worlds. My personal world-building project has become
          the largest project I've ever worked on, as I've been making changes
          and additions to it almost daily for many years now. Most of my work
          is of characters from this world. Most of my work is made with Adobe
          Fresco using a Wacom drawing tablet plugged into my laptop, nothing
          fancy but it does the trick. Below are some of my artworks of original
          characters.

      <div class="parallax parallax-one">
        <div class="art-info right">
          <h2>Serena</h2>
          <p>
            This character is part of a world-building project I'm working on.
            I'm not sure if I'll ever share it with the world, but I'm still
            working on it for fun. This is one of my favourite characters.

        <div class="art-info right info-bottom">
          <h2>Jun and Kaede</h2>
          <p>
            Jun started out as a stand-alone character, but I developed a new
            project around her, including a new character named Kaede. They hunt
            yokai in a future version of Tokyo, which I found to be an
            interesting setting for a story. I really enjoyed designing their
            clothing, because it's a very different style than I'm used to.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="parallax parallax-two">
        <div class="art-info left">
          <h2>Navi</h2>
          <p>
            This is the main character of one of my projects, he is an elven
            soldier who finds out he is the god of lightning. I used this
            artwork to rework the armour designs of the nation he's from. I also
            liked making this artwork more cinematic than I usually do.
          </p>

      <div class="parallax parallax-axelia">
        <div class="art-info right">
          <h2>Axelia Zephyr</h2>
          <p>
            Axelia Zephyr is the daughter of Senator Hesperis Zephyr, a very
            influential man. She is human, unlike many of my other characters.
            She is a driven and skilled warrior who proudly fights for her
            homeland. She cares little about her noble status and works hard to
            achieve her goals. This character was first created so the
            overarching story could be viewed from the perspective of what the
            other characters regard as the enemy.
          </p>

      <div class="parallax parallax-lyra">
        <div class="art-info left">
          <h2>Lyra</h2>
          <p>
            Lyra is another human character who is a dear friend of Axelia. She
            comes from humble beginnings, but managed to make a name for herself
            as a skilled healer. She can be hotheaded and stubborn, but she is
            always there for those who need her. She has a rich cultural
            background within the world I created. Her clothing, armour,
            piercings, face painting and even her weoponry originate from these
            different cultures she is a part of.

          <h2>Danji</h2>
          <p>
            Danji is the character I play as in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign.
            He is a changeling, meaning that he can shapeshift. I really like
            this character, as he has a very rich backstory.

        <div class="art-info left">
          <h2>Caelum</h2>
          <p>
            The god of space and the sky. He was heavily wounded in the war that
            got him banished from the pantheon. The single wing on his right and
            the three arms on his left create an interesting silhouette.

      <div class="parallax parallax-four">
        <div class="art-info right">
          <h2>Desideria</h2>
          <p>
            Desideria is the demigoddess of lust and desire. On top of that, she
            is the Queen of a powerful nation. I wanted to make her look regal,
            so I gave her a lot of golden jewelry and a crown based on ancient
            Egyptian regents. The usage of pink and red tones symbolise her
            divine powers.
