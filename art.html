        <p>
          For as long as I can remember I've loved to draw. A few years ago I
          started drawing digitally as well. My art mostly revolves around
          character design, as I love world-building and creating characters to
          inhabit those worlds. Most of my characters are from a world
          I've been working on for many years.
          Below are some of my artworks of original characters.

          <h2>Serena</h2>
          <p>
            Serena is one of my favourite characters. She's the daughter of a crime boss, but has left that life behind her long ago. After a brief period of crimefighting as a vigilante, she now keeps her city safe as part of the city guard.

          <h2>Jun and Kaede</h2>
          <p>
            Jun started out as a stand-alone character, but I developed a new
            project around her, including a new character named Kaede. They hunt
            yokai in a alternate reality of Tokyo in the year 2052. I enjoyed designing their
            clothing, as it's a very different style from what I'm used to.

          <p>
            Navi is a dedicated elven soldier with a complicated past. I used this
            artwork to re-establish the armour design of the nation he's from.

          <h2>Axelia Zephyr</h2>
          <p>
            Axelia Zephyr is the daughter of Senator Hesperis Zephyr, a very
            influential man. She is human, unlike many of my other characters.
            She is a driven and skilled warrior who proudly fights for her
            homeland. She cares little about her noble status and works hard to
            achieve her goals. This character was first created so the
            overarching story could be viewed from an opposing perspective.

        <div class="art-info">
          <h2>Lyra</h2>
          <p>
            Lyra is another human character who is a dear friend of Axelia. She
            comes from humble beginnings, but managed to make a name for herself
            as a skilled warrior. She can be hotheaded and stubborn, but she is
            always there for those who need her. She has a rich cultural
            background within the world I created. Her clothing, armour,
            piercings, face paintings and even her weoponry originate from the
            different cultures she's part of.

          <h2>Danji</h2>
          <p>
            Danji is the character I played as in a Dungeons & Dragons campaign.
            He is a changeling, meaning that he can shapeshift. His character arc revolves around finding his own identity and trusting those around him. With this artwork I experimented with animated transitions between his different forms.

          <h2>Luna</h2>
          <p>
            Goddess of the Moon and Night. Luna was corrupted by the Goddess of the Void, which is reflected in this design. While wearing emblems resembling the moon, her skin reflects the night sky instead. Older generations of Gods in my world have six arms, inspired by Hindu deities. In this artwork I wanted to show that these arms can physically interact with objects and even with each other, instead of just being symbolical.

          <h2>Caelum</h2>
          <p>
            The God of Space and the Sky. He was heavily wounded in the war that
            got him banished from the pantheon. The single wing on his right and
            the three arms on his left create an interesting silhouette.

          <h2>Desideria</h2>

            Desideria is the Demigoddess of Lust and Desire. On top of that, she
            is the queen of a powerful nation. To make her look regal I gave her a lot of golden jewelry and a crown based on ancient
            Egyptian regents. The usage of pink and red tones symbolise her divine powers.
