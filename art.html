      <p>For as long as I can remember, I've loved to draw. 
        Recently, I've started drawing digitally. My art mostly 
        revolves around character design, with one of my most unique characters being Tsumi, seen in the artwork above. I mostly work
        with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Fresco, and some backgrounds are AI generated.
        Below are artworks of a few of my original characters.
      </p></section>
      <div class="parallax parallax-one"><div class="art-info right">
        <h2>Serena</h2>
        <p>This character is part of a world-building project I'm working on. I'm not sure if I'll ever share it with the world, but I'm still working on it for fun. This is one of my favourite characters.
        </p></div>
      </div>
        <div class="parallax parallax-two"><div class="art-info left">
          <h2>Navi</h2>
          <p>This is the main character of my project, he is a soldier who figures out he is 
            the god of lightning. This drawing is actually a second attempt. I took the Illustrator file
            of the original drawing and redid some of the effects and details from what I've 
            learned since I originally drew it.
          </p></div></div>
        <div class="parallax parallax-three"><div class="art-info right info-bottom">
          <h2>Tempestia</h2>
          <p>The goddess of time. The twelve 
            chains represent the hours on a clock. With this drawing I used AI to generate
            the background. I then matched the lighting to blend everything together.
          </p></div></div>
          <div class="parallax parallax-four"><div class="art-info left">
            <h2>Akira</h2>
            <p>This character lives in a dystopian future. I just wanted to experiment with different settings, but I liked this character so much, 
              that I worked her into my project.
            </p></div></div>
          <div class="parallax parallax-five"><div class="black-gradient grdnt-left"></div><div class="art-info right">
            <h2>Jun</h2>
            <p>Jun is not part of any project. I drew her for the first time a long time ago in the back of my math notebook,
              and I wanted to see how I'd draw her now. I also liked drawing something more modern and artistic. 
              I also experimented with new details like blush and a more abstract background.
            </p></div></div>
          <div class="parallax parallax-six"><div class="black-gradient grdnt-left"></div><div class="art-info right">
            <h2>White Queen</h2>
            <p>This character is based on the chess piece. I first made this character for my animation elective. I
              liked her design so much, I decided to draw her in a full artwork. I drew her in Adobe Illustrator and made the background 
              and some of the effects in Adobe Fresco.
            </p></div></div>
            <section class="text-box">
              <p>That's all for now. However, if you want to see more, you can follow me on Instagram
                at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dvdruenen.art/" target="_blank">@dvdruenen.art</a>, where I try to
                post regularly. For some drawings you can also check out a timelapse of my drawing process.
