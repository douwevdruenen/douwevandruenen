        <p>
          For as long as I can remember I've loved to draw. A few years ago I
          started drawing digitally as well. My art mostly revolves around
          character design, as I love world-building and creating characters to
          inhabit those worlds. I mostly work with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe
          Fresco, and some backgrounds are AI generated. Below are some of my
          best artworks so far.
        </p>
      </section>
      <div class="parallax parallax-one">
        <div class="art-info left">
          <h2>Serena</h2>
          <p>
            This character is part of a world-building project I'm working on.
            I'm not sure if I'll ever share it with the world, but I'm still
            working on it for fun. This is one of my favourite characters.
          </p>

      <div class="parallax parallax-five">
        <div class="black-gradient grdnt-left"></div>
        <div class="art-info right info-bottom">
          <h2>Jun and Kaede</h2>
          <p>
            Jun started out as a stand-alone character, but I developed a new
            project around her, including a new character named Kaede. They hunt
            yokai in a future version of Tokyo, which I found to be an
            interesting setting for a story. This drawing is made in a style I
            adapted most recently.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="parallax parallax-two">
        <div class="art-info left">
          <h2>Navi</h2>
          <p>
            This is the main character of one of my projects, he is an elven
            soldier who finds out he is the god of lightning. This drawing is
            actually a second attempt. I took the Illustrator file of the
            original drawing and redid some of the effects and details from what
            I'd learned since I originally drew it.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="parallax parallax-three">
        <div class="art-info left info-bottom">
          <h2>Tempestia</h2>
          <p>
            The goddess of time. The twelve chains represent the hours on a
            clock. I like to challenge myselfd, so I decided to put the primary
            light scource beneath the character. With this drawing I used AI to
            generate the background. I then matched the lighting to blend the
            character and the background together.

      <div class="parallax parallax-four">
        <div class="art-info right">
          <h2>Jinx</h2>
          <p>
            Jinx is a character from the Netflix series Arcane. I really liked
            her design, so I decided to draw her. It was interesting to see how
            the character looked in my own artstyle, and eventhough this style
            is partly inspired by Arcane's artstyle, the artwork still looks
            unique.

      <div class="parallax parallax-vesana">
        <div class="art-info left">
          <h2>King Vesana</h2>
          <p>
            This character is a female pirate King. With this drawing I combined
            a few different styles to create a new look. I liked drawing this
            character, as she seems pretty unhinged.

      <div class="parallax parallax-six">
        <div class="black-gradient grdnt-left"></div>
        <div class="art-info right">
          <h2>White Queen</h2>
          <p>
            This character is based on the chess piece. I first made this
            character for my animation elective. I liked her design so much, I
            decided to draw her in a full artwork. I drew her in Adobe
            Illustrator and made the background and some of the effects in Adobe
            Fresco.
