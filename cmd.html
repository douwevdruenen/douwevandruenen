          I am, above all, a designer. I study Communication & Multimedia Design
          (CMD) at Zuyd Hogeschool Maastricht, where I've picked up skills like
          visual design, UX-design, animation and many more. I also study coding
          and programming, a skill I use often. This website is an example of
          that. Besides my studies, I've also done projects for other
          organisations. Below are a few projects I've worked on as a multimedia
          designer.

          <h2>Code4Kids</h2>
          <p>
            At the end of my first year at CMD, we did a project where we had to
            supply a workshop for grade school students to teach them basic
            coding. That's where Codingcat was born. I was mostly responsible
            for the visual design on the project. I designed the logo, the
            website, a boardgame, and much more. We also gave the workshop to a
            full class of 12-year-olds, which was a lot of fun.

          <h2>Multimedia Story</h2>
          <p>
            In my third year at CMD, I had an internship at the Centraal Bureau
            voor de Statistiek (CBS). Here I worked on a project to make a
            multimedia story about the European Green Deal. I was primarily
            responsible for the illustrations and animations of the story. You

            During my internship, I also designed posters for a presentation at
            the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where they even asked to keep
            the posters. After my internship, I was asked to make a new batch of
            posters for a convention, a project I gladly took on.

          <h2>Generative Art</h2>
          <p>
            In my first year at CMD, I did a project where I programmed
            generative art, that randomly makes a moving art piece within a
            strict ruleset. It was very fun to work on, and I even got to use my
            visuals to accompany a live jazz band.

          <h2>Knip Musical</h2>
          <p>
            The high school I used to go to has its own musical group that
            performs a musical every year in the biggest theatre in Helmond. I
            personally know the producer, who approached me in 2022 for the
            design of the poster for their musical, Ik hou van jou. The
            following year I not only designed the poster for their new musical,
            Pinokkio, but I also designed their new logo. <br /><br />In 2024 I
            continued my work for Knip Musical with the musical "Tranen van
            Smaragd", where I made designs for the poster, flyers, banners for
            in the theatre and a digital billboard next to a busy road in
            Helmond. The design I made were also featured on projections during
            the musical itself.
