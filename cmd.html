      <p>I study Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD) at Zuyd Hogeschool 
        Maastricht. Here I study visual design, UX-design, animation and much more. I also study coding and programming, a skill I use often. This website is an example of that.
        A good example of a project where a lot of my skills came together, is the video playing above. This is a project where I made, and programmed,
        randomly generated art to accompany a live jazz band. 
        Below are a few more projects I've done as a CMD student.

        <h2>Code4Kids</h2>
        <p>At the end of my first year at CMD, we did a project where we had to supply a 
            workshop for grade school students to teach them basic coding. That's where 
            Codingcat was born. I was mostly responsible for the visual design on the project. 
            I designed the logo, the website, a boardgame, and much more. We also gave the workshop 
            to a full class of 12-year-olds, which was a lot of fun. The website we made is still 
            up and running at <a onclick="window.open('https://coding-cat.nl', '_blank')">coding-cat.nl</a>

          <h2>Multimedia Story</h2>
          <p>Halfway through my second year at CMD, we did a project for the 
            Centraal Bureau voor Statistieken (CBS). My team was asked to make a story 
            explaining the relation 
            between soy from Brazil and meat in China. I was mainly responsible for the 
            illustrations 
            and animations on the project. Follow <a onclick="window.open('https://mia-mms-2223.github.io/team08/', '_blank')">this link</a> to view the story yourself.

        <h2>2D Animation</h2>
        <p>In my second year, I followed an elective where I learned to make 2D animations. I experimented with a lot of different animation styles and I made a short animation about a girl and a dragon who live by a waterfall. You can watch it <a onclick="window.open('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq0xxq5xz28&ab_channel=DouwevanDruenen', '_blank')">here</a>.

        <h2>3D Animation</h2>
        <p>In my second year, I also followed an elective where I learned to use 
          Blender to make 3D animations. I wanted to make satisfying renders, an 
          example of which you can see here. You can check out 
          <a onclick="window.open('https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4qNP_BrULqICGbYTuilZepkyRGEkmeTS', '_blank')">this playlist</a> on my YouTube channel to see more of my 3D animations.
