          I am a designer at heart. I study Communication & Multimedia Design
          (CMD) at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences in Maastricht, where I've
          picked up many skills like graphic design, UX-design, animation,
          coding, motion design and more. Besides my studies, I've also done
          projects for other organisations. Below are a few projects I've worked
          on as a multimedia designer.

          <h2>Royal in Motion</h2>
          <p>
            In my fourth year of CMD, I did a project for Royal Theater, an
            artistic cinema in Heerlen. They are undergoing a large renovation
            and wanted to reimagine their branding. Together with a classmate, I
            made the concept 'Royal in Motion'. The concept revolves around the
            motion of a film camera, the motion of innovation and the motion of
            the visitors coming together in the new Royal. I was mainly
            responsible for the motion design. We presented our project in the
            cinema on the big screen and the client was very positive about the
            result.

          <h2>Codingcat</h2>
          <p>
            At the end of my first year at CMD, we did a project called
            'Code4Kids' where we had to develop a workshop for grade school
            students to teach them basic coding. That's where Codingcat was
            born. I was mostly responsible for the visual design on the project.
            I designed the logo, the website, a boardgame, and much more. We
            also gave the workshop to a full class of 12-year-olds, which was a
            lot of fun.

          <h2>Multimedia Story</h2>
          <p>
            In my third year at CMD, I had an internship at Centraal Bureau voor
            de Statistiek (CBS). Here I worked on a project to make a multimedia
            story about the European Green Deal. I was primarily responsible for
            the illustrations and animations of the story. You can click

            to view the story yourself. <br /><br />
            During my internship, I also designed posters for a presentation at
            the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where they even asked to keep
            the posters. After my internship, I was asked to make a new batch of
            posters for a convention, a project I gladly took on.

          <h2>Generative Art</h2>
          <p>
            In my first year at CMD, I did a project where I programmed
            generative art, that randomly makes a moving art piece within a
            strict ruleset. It was very fun to work on, and I even got to use my
            visuals to accompany a live jazz band.

          <h2>Knip Musical</h2>
          <p>
            The high school I used to go to has its own musical group that
            performs a musical every year in the biggest theatre in Helmond. I
            personally know the producer, who approached me in 2022 for the
            design of the poster for their musical, Ik hou van jou. The
            following year I not only designed the poster for their new musical,
            Pinokkio, but I also designed their new logo. <br /><br />In 2024 I
            continued my work for Knip Musical with the musical "Tranen van
            Smaragd", where I made designs for the poster, flyers, banners for
            in the theatre and a digital billboard next to a busy road in
            Helmond. The design I made were also featured on projections during
            the musical itself.
